                        <h4>OUR STORY</h4>
                            <p>Long, long ago in a land where the sun is always shining and the palm trees grow tall, there was a Man. One day, this Man decided to grow a beard.
                            And it was EPIC!</p>
                            <br>
                        
                            <p> No, not really! That was just the beginning. Although, letâ€™s face it, a man with a beard has that "THING". Which is why most men decide to grow it. And that is how The Bearded Gent was born. Because once a man starts growing his beard, he gets to realise that it also needs all the it can get.
                            Fortunately, he had a friend who had a big beard just like him and happened to be smart.  So together, they began a quest to sell the best beard products in the world. They chose the best organic brands, making sure that they were also best for all kinds of beards.
                            
                            And that is how The Bearded Gent came to be, with adventure, and a little bit of love!</p>
